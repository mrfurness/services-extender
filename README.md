# beta services-extender

This is the beta branch were I develop new features, but it also contains some required differences in key files so that I can upload it as a different version as part of how Chrome Web Store handles the testing program. While it may from time to time feature complete and stable versions I also use it to manage work in progress so use at your own risk.

That said I use the version below to beta test upcoming stable releases.
